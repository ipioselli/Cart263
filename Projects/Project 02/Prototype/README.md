#Project 02 Proposal:

This is a prototype of the general mechanics of the game. You must choose an egg to raise.
Then you can move around in your house. There is an energy counter and time of day. For now only the energy counter affects the game play. However, in the project the day will start at 6am and stop at 12am. For now only the feeding game works. You must press a button to get the instructions and it will give you a hint to guess the tamagotchi's favourite food. If the food is right the energy goes up by 10 points but if you get it wrong the energy goes down by 10 points. There is no limit to how many you can guess so that the user can feed the tamagotchi throughout the day when they see the energy running low.
