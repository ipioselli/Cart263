Exercise 04: Bubble Popper

This program takes inspiration from the show Neon Genesis Evangelion
Instead of a bubble you must stab the angel with the pin to save the world.
There are seven angels to kill. Each time you kill one their speed gets faster and size gets
smaller. There is also a timer of 5 seconds so you must kill all the angels before the timer runs out.
