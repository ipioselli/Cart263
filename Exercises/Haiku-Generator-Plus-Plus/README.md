# Exercise 05: Haiku Generator

This program generates a Haiku from pre-existing array of lines and titles. Once you click
on either a line or title, they fade out and are swapped with another random line. Clicking
on the lines also triggers responsive voice to recite the lines and title in a Japanese voice.
Lastly, when you hover over the letters in the main title, they fly away.
