        <span class="leaving">Bella sees her baby girl, Renesmee, for the first time.</span> <span class="leaving">She takes her in arms and Jacob starts to act protective over the baby</span></p>

      <span class="leaving">Jacob: All right. That's enough experimenting for one day.</span>
      <br><span class="leaving">Edward: Jacob. She's doing great.</span>
      <br><span class="leaving">Jacob:</span> <span class="grower">Y</span><span class="leaving">eah. Let's not push it th</span><span class="grower">o</span><span class="leaving">ugh.</span>

      <br><span class="leaving">Bella: What's yo</span><span class="grower">u</span> <span class="leaving">r problem?</span>

      <br><span class="leaving"> Rosalie: Oh. Do tell her, Jacob.</span>

      <br><span class="leaving">Emmett: This should be good.</span>

      <br><span class="leaving">Edward: Hold o</span><span class="grower">n</span> <span class="leaving">a second.</span>
      <p><span class="leaving">(Edward takes Renesmee from her)</span></p>
      <span class="leaving">Jacob: Bella. Look,</span> <span class="grower">i</span><span class="leaving">t's a wolf thing.</span>
      <br><span class="leaving">Bella: What's a wolf thing?</span>
      <br><span class="leaving">Jacob: Um... You know we have no </span><span class="grower">c</span><span class="leaving">ontrol over it. We can't choose who it happens with.</span><span class="leaving"> And it doesn't mean what you thin</span><span class="grower">k</span><span class="leaving">, Bella. I promise.</span>
      <br><span class="leaving">Bella: Take Re</span><span class="grower">n</span><span class="leaving">esmee out of the room.</span>

      <span class="leaving">Bella: Edward, don't touch m</span><span class="grower">e</span><span class="leaving"> right now. I don't want to hurt you.</span>
      <p><span class="leaving">(E</span><span class="grower">d</span><span class="leaving">ward takes his hand away, furious with Jacob, Bella</span> <span class="leaving">grabs hold of him and throws him out of the house) (After throwing Jacob out of the house)</span></p>
      Bella: You i<span class="grower">m</span>printed on m <span class="grower">y</span> <span class="grower">daughter</span>?
      <br>Jacob: It wasn't my choice!
      <br>Bella: She's a baby!
      <br>Jacob: It's not like that. You think Edward would let me live if it was? <br>Edward: I'm still debating it.
      <br>Bella: I've held her once! One time, Jacob! And already you think that you have some moronic wolfy claim on her? She's mine!
      <p>(Bella suddenly strikes Jacob hard in the face and Leah and Seth in their wolf form arrive on the scene)</p>
      Jacob: It's fine, Leah.
      <br>Bella: You're gonna stay away from her.
      <br>Jacob: You know I can't do that.
      (Bella punches Jacob hard in the stomach and he falls down)
      Esme: Stop her, Edward.
      <br>Edward: He said it's fine. She's amazing, right?
      <br>Jacob: Do you remember how much you wanted to be around me 3 days ago? That's gone now, right?
      <br>Bella: Long gone.
      <br>Jacob: Because it was her. From the beginning it was Nessie who wanted me there.
      <br>Bella: Nessie? You nicknamed my daughter after the Loch Ness monster?</span>
