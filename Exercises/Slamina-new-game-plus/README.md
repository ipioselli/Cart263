# Exercise 02 : Slamina new game plus

This project incorporates responsiveVoice and annyang to detect audio input from users. The female voice will say a random fruit backwards from the array of fruit words and the user must guess which fruit it is. They must say "I think it is a " and then say the fruit in its proper form. If the user gets a word wrong the sentence turns red and they get a bad sfx. After 5 wrong answers you lose. If they get a word right the sentence turns green and they get a good sfx. After 5 right answers they win the game.
